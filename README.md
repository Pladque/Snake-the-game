# Snake-the-game

1. This application, written in C++, simulates the standard "Snake Game", in which player takes control over the creature, avoiding collapsing with any object, including the snake itself. The goal is to feed the snake with fruits/animals, making it grow bigger, and scoring points for keeping it safe.

2. Done: 
*basic Snake class, which defines snake behavior/properties
*configuration of SFML, which will be used in the future to implement some graphic features
*Snake representation rendering on the map,
*pseudo random fruits/objects creation and rendering on the map,

3. To do:
*interaction with enviroment, ie. fruits, other animals, obstacles which could stop the snake from moving,
*interaction with user, simple GUI to start/quit the game, adjust options etc,
*music (???),
*another snake, controlled by computer, which could increase difficulty, by invoking collision with player (???)

*??? mark means optional, "to be discussed" features.

4. Difficulties:
*Graphics
